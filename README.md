#Purpose of the repo

This code is the first c++ project I have built. It allows the user to specify in a txt file different point, sphere or cube shaped objects and collide them into each other. 

While functional and respecting the law of conservation of momentum, the code works very slow due in part to my unexpert command of the language, and in other part due to n particles needing to check for n^2 collissions.

To run the code, build the project from the main_V3 file. For an example of the codes functionality, see the result_240527 GIF.

Dependencies: GNUplot
